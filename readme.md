##Predicting the Market, Boston Housing.

In this project I build a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical 
analysis tools. I identify the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.  There are two files:

+ .py
+ .pdf

Read the report while running the .py file.  You need to have a few libraries installed in order to use the python file, namely, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and pylab.

Enjoy
